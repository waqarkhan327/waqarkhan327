ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Waqar Khan

I make Mobile Apps for `Android` (8/10), `iOS` (4/10 working on it..) and `Flutter` (4/10 also working on it ;) ). I'm pretty good at designing the complex apps from scratch and as well as maintiaining the already developed apps. During my career, I've worked on 10+ large scale apps and many small apps.
I've also got some experience with backend technologies like `python` `laravel` `php` `mongoDB` `MySQL` `SQL Server` and `Linux`

Following are some projects I made and most proud of..
 - **[Vidly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockvillegroup.vidly)** A movie streaming app like Netflix
 - **[Bajao](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bajao.music)** A music streaming app like Spotify
 - **[RoPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockvillegroup.Ropay)** A FinTech app that allows small merchants to accept QR Payments from multiple platforms that supports `MasterPass`
 - **[CB Card+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbbank.cbcard)** A FinTech app for Card Management and NFC Payments (Tap to Pay) for CB Bank customers
 - **[Vattanac Wallet](https://appadvice.com/app/vattanac-wallet/1473397830)** A FinTech eWallet app powered by Vattanac Bank, for Payments and Transfers etc
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS and Flutter
